# ece471-proj1
Alejandro's and Jose's big project that is freaking cool.

### Requirements
For each message you should find out the type of encryption that was used, as well as the key and the plaintext to show you decrypted it properly (if it can be decrypted). If you cannot decrypt a message for whatever reason, please explain why.

Possible Encryption Schemes:
* Shift Cipher
* Subsitution Cipher
* Vigenere Cipher
* Permutation Cipher (Columnar Transposition)
* One-Time Pad

### Input
Java command line with text file as input file
(ex: ece471-proj1 cipher1.txt)

### Goals
Develop logic and algorithm to determine the cipher types and decrypt the messages.

Need overall strategy to reduce time complexity of cipher-cracking algorithms.

Use as little human effort as possible.

### Minimum Set of Required functions:
* Frequency analysis
* Index of Coincidence
* Decryption function
